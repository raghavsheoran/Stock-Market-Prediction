# Stock-Market-Prediction
The popularity of stock market trading is continuously increasing, prompting experts to develop new methods for predicting the future utilizing new techniques. The forecasting technique benefits not only scholars, but also investors and anyone involved in the stock market. A forecasting model with high accuracy is required to assist in the prediction of stock indexes. We used one of the most precise forecasting technologies in this work, which uses a Recurrent Neural Network and a Long Short-Term Memory unit for predicting the stock market's future situation. We can also conclude that by taking different combinations of given variables as parameters for the model, we can acquire higher accuries, which makes us aware of the fact
that "More data with better models produces outstanding results".
